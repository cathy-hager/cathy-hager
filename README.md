- 👋 Hi, I’m @cathy-hager
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to code so that I may be able to find part time work.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to navigate Odin Project.  This will be all new to me somewhat.  I am a stem teacher in a middle school but was orginally a
- math teacher.  I am also older and have some years before I can retire.  So I am willing to learn a new skill set. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on how to use code in the real world.
- 📫 How to reach me is through email cathy.hager@uasdraiders.org
